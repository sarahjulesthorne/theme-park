# Theme Park  
### Description  
The project is an exercise in basic XMLHR requests.  
It creates an XMLHR request to pull data from the project's JSON file.  
As part of building the request, we added event listeners for load and error events and called a function in each case.  
Console.logs and console.errors served as the means of testing the code.
